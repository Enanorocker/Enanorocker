## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I don't know what to type (pees himself)

Currently learning how to code but i'd like to be a videogame developer one day, i'm very passionate about the writing and philosophy behind videogame developing but i just can't get the graps of what coding on that level could ever be, as i've only learned how to code really simple things up until now.
